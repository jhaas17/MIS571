### Problem Description
Our goal is to design a database for our fitness studio to keep a better overview of our accounts and memberships. The fitness studio offers a variety of daily classes and offers different membership options with varying number of classes that members are allowed to take. The studio also sells retail merchandise such as T-shirts, water bottles, sweatshirts, etc. We will also need to keep track of our employees which include salespeople and instructors. 

#### What our database will include and generate reports on: 
- Revenue: The income that our business takes in from normal operations and activities. We will be able to track and compare the different sources of income such as merchandise and memberships. This will also help us be able to understand what items sell the best and be able to focus on advertising these items.
- Class enrollment: Our database will also track class enrollment so we can see which members are signed up for which classes. This will also give us a better understanding of what type of class members enjoy and adjust our schedule to accommodate customers' needs.
- Membership sales: The Fitness studio offers various membership options with varying numbers of classes that customers are allowed to take per month. Tracking how many customers hold each type of membership will give us a better understanding of our customersâ€™ needs. 
- Retail sales: Tracking retails sales allows us to order more merchandise when we are running low as well as seeing what type of items sell best and creating more similar items.
- Employee performance: The database will keep track of the number of memberships sold by each employee which will give the manager concrete statistics to reward outstanding employees and to focus on improving the performance of underperforming employees.
